When we have to perform a certain operation multiple times, then we take the help of loops. 

Eg:

Let's say we need to print happy. 

We can do this by using printf(“happy”);

But what if we need to print happy 5 times or 1000 times? 

Shall we repeat the same code printf(“happy”) 1000 times?

No, this is not a good idea. Here we use the concept of loops.

#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
int x;
scanf("%d", &x);
for( int i=0;i<x;i++) { 
printf("sony");
}
}
