Consider a problem: There is an exam of 100 maximum marks. you have to assign the grade to the student. you will assign the grades A, B, and C. there is a rule for assigning the grades. if the score of a student is greater than 70 then the grade will be A, if the score is greater than 40, then the grade will be B, else grade will be C.

Let's write code for it.

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {

    int x;

    scanf(“%d”, &x);

    if (x > 70) {

        printf(“Grade A”);

    }

    if (x > 40) {

        printf(“Grade B”);

    }

    if (x >= 0) {

        printf(“Grade C”);

    }

    return 0;

}


Do you think this code is correct? 

When we run this code for x = 75, the output would be:

Grade A

Grade B

Grade C

This is because all the conditions here are true for x = 75. We need to ensure that only one statement should be printed. We can do this by adding more conditions.

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {

    int x;

    scanf(“%d”, &x);

    if (x > 70) {

        printf(“Grade A”);

    }

    if (x > 40 and x <= 70) {

        printf(“Grade B”);

    }

    if (x >= 0 and x <= 40) {

        printf(“Grade C”);

    }

    return 0;

}

This code will run fine for the above problem.
