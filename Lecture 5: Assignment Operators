Eg. x  = y;

On the left side, there should be a variable but on the right side, there can be a value or expression. 5 = x is an invalid operation.

There are some special assignment operators like += , -= , *= , /= and %= (also called shorthand operators).

Thing to note: There shouldn't be a space between the symbols: + = is wrong, it should be +=, they are used in conjunction.

Eg. a += x;

         That means a = a + x;

 a  *= x; // a = a * x



#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
int a = 7 ;
a %= 3; //  it can be += , -= but  not + = , there should not be any space
printf("%d \n", a);
return 0 ;
}
