Relational operators are used for comparison purposes. There are >, <, >=, and many more relational operators. When we compare two variables or values, it returns something. In the case of relational operators, True (a non-zero value 1 ) or False (zero 0) is returned.

Eg.   x > y // It will return true (a non-zero value) if the value of x is greater than the value of y else it will return false (zero 0).

 #include<stdio.h>

Int main(){

    int a = 7;

    int b = a +  3;

    printf(“%d ” , a > b);

    return 0;

}

Output : 0

Explanation: Because the expression is not true, the relational operator returned false, that is 0.

== operator: It is used for equality checks.

 Eg: a == b; // returns true if both a and b are equal else it will return false.

!= operator: It is used for non-equality checks.

Eg. a != b; // returns true if both a and b are not equal else it will return false.
