Simple if statement is used for decision-making.

Syntax:-

if (some condition) {

    -- operations to be done if condition is true --

}

"some condition" is an expression. It can be true or false. If the expression is true, then the inner code of the if condition will execute.

    Line1 code

    Line2 code

    if (condition) {

        Line3 code

    }

    Line4 code

So Line3 would only execute when the condition or expression inside the if condition is True.

Let's check if a number is odd or even with the help of a simple if statement.

Pseudo code:-

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {

    int x;

    scanf(“%d”, &x);

    if (x % 2 == 0) {

        printf(“EVEN”);

    }

    if (x % 2 != 0) {

        printf(“ODD”);

    }

    return 0;

}
