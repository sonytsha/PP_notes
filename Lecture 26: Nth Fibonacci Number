// family of numbers : known as fibonacci numbers
// series of numbers, first two elements 0,1
term 0 is 0 and term 1 is 0, i th number is = sum of prev 2 num 
// t(i) = t(i-1) + t(i-2) when i > 1
// 0,1,1,2,3,5,8.....
// print n th fib num

// first 2 elements are 1 and 2 , 3rd variable is = 1st + 2nd, 
// temp = prev + current 
// prev = current, current = temp
