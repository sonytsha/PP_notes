%s when sees a space it stop scanning 

to find the length of the string : as we know that the last character of the string is null which is initialized by '\0', hence we are running loop till it finds null character
// why i =0 initialized, in case of for loop we initalize i value within the loop but in while loop , if we dont initialize then it till wake random garbage value
// while word of garbage value will prooduce error hence assigned to 0

#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
char word1[100] = "this is awesome!!!";
int i=0, len = 0;
while(word1[i] !='\0') {
len++;
i++;
}
printf("%d\n", len);
return 0;
}
