Approach :- We can find the maximum element with the help of the previous article. Now that we have decided that one element is maximum, we can say that the maximum among the remaining two elements would be the second maximum in the three elements.

Eg. x = 10, y = 5, z = 8;

Now since 10 is maximum, between 5 and 8, 8 is greater. Hence 8 is the second maximum element.

Pseudo code:- 

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {

int x, y, z;

scanf(“%d %d %d”, &x, &y, &z);

if(x >= y && x >= z){

if(y >= z)

printf(“%d”, y);

else

printf(“%d”, z);

} else if (y >= x && y >= z) {

if(x >= z)

printf(“%d”, x);

else

printf(“%d”, z);

} else {

if(y >= x)

printf(“%d”, y);

else

printf(“%d”, x);

}

return 0;

}
